<h2><b>Blog</b></h2>
This is a test project to see all that goes into making a blog. Right now the website can create a new blog and post it to the website. It can edit the blogs through a wysiwig that was setup in the backend, and can delete the posts as well.

<h2><b>Tech</b></h2>
I used react.js as the fronted and used Django for the backend.

<h2><b>Current Status</b></h2>
There is still a lot more the blog is lacking in terms of what you would expect
from a normal blog. I would like to add the ability to comment on blogs, sign
up, and favorite certain categories of blogs that a user likes.
